    <h2>5 Easy Healthy Recipes</h2>
    <p>Eating healthy doesn’t have to be boring or expensive. Here are five recipes you can try this week using simple, accessible, and nutritious ingredients.</p>
    
    <section class="recipe">
      <h3>1. Quinoa & Black Bean Salad</h3>
      <p>This salad is high in fiber and protein, packed with vegetables, and great for meal prep. Use cooked quinoa, canned black beans, diced peppers, red onion, cilantro, lime juice, olive oil, salt, and pepper. Top with avocado slices for healthy fats.</p>

      <h3>2. Overnight Oats with Fruit & Nuts</h3>
      <p>A quick breakfast: combine oats, milk (or plant-based milk), chia seeds, and a little honey. Let it soak overnight in fridge. In the morning add fresh fruit (berries or banana) and chopped nuts for added texture and nutrition.</p>
